Did my initial work in this repo: https://github.com/quoniken/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/project/image-filter-starter-code

At some point in the course it was mentioned to fork the udacity cloud-developer repo but I didn't make a separate repo until I learned you needed to at the project submission page.
